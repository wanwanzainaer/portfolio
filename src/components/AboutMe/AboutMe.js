      <p>
        I am a FullStack developer and iOS developer. I'm
        extraordinarily motivated by the desire to achieve higher
        level of coding skills by challenging myself everyday.
        According to fullstack development, I use HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript and React to build interactive web pages, using
        Node and MongoDB to build server side In addition, my
        deploying processes are powered by Docker. For iOS
        developement, I have more than two years industrial
        experiences using Object-C , Swift and cocoapod to build iOS
        app.
